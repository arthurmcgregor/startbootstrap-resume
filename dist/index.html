                            <p>This personal project has been an enjoyable learning experience. As an electric vehicle (EV) driver, I need to know where the nearest fast charge stations are. Although there are many maps already available, this is a unique solution because it shows full details for current stations, as well as under construction and future chargers. In addition, you can view a list of all chargers and identify the nearest chargers to your current position. The app is a fully responsive, progressive web app, with Google Analytics tracking and automatic deployment from GitHub.</p>
                            <p>hiko.kiwi has been built in VueJS, is hosted on Google&apos;s Firebase platform, with a supporting server built in NodeJS and hosted on Heroku. The map service is provided by Mapbox which allows for a high level of customisation. The server runs a script daily to fetch the station data from two sources. The first EVROAM, a REST API which provides a JSON of all active and under construction stations that meet NZTA criteria. The second is a Google Map which displays all active, under construction and future stations. This requires processing from a KML into a GeoJSON and filtering to remove duplication.</p>

The &apos;cacophonator&apos; will lure predators with sound and light, use a thermal camera and machine learning algorithms to identify the predator, and finally eliminate the predator using a mechanised air gun that fires a sticky poison pellet.

                                I have been involved since early June 2018 as a volunteer contributor. I am primarily helping to improve the web portal which allows for remote monitoring of the cacophonators. In particular, I have assisted with the transition from Node/Express to VueJS which has involved rebuilding the app from the ground up to be more mobile responsive and easier to maintain in the long term. Most of my time has been spent building the

                                <li>I was heavily involved in the deployment of a new IT system &apos;Schoolbox&apos;. This acted as a combined portal, intranet and learning management system. I was able to quickly learn how the system worked and became the lead &apos;Champion&apos; in its delivery. I was given &apos;superuser&apos; admin rights which enabled me to assist my colleagues one-on-one and when leading professional development workshops. I attended the Schoolbox Meetup 2017 in Melbourne where I presented on our implementation journey. I was also a member of the ICT committee.</li>

                                    I developed an innovative cross-curricular course for Year 11 students which combined aspects of Physics with Technology. With a space exploration theme, students developed

                                    using Arduino microprocessors then used their Physics knowledge to design, build and launch model rockets. Developing this course required me to integrate knowledge and skills from different subject domains, in addition to building positive relationships with a wide range of colleagues. The course was well-received and featured in the

                                <li>I led a team of four staff to review the College academic reporting process. I used my group facilitation skills as we discussed how to reduce workload and improve efficiencies for staff. I summarised our discussion and produced a formal report which was presented to the curriculum leaders for consideration.</li>
                                <li>I was invited to be a member of the Curriculum Review &apos;Drive Team&apos;. We examined current methodology accross the school, reviewed best practice for curriculum delivery and evaluated options for improvement. I was a strong advocate for change to implement a more modern, flexible and student-focused approach to learning. I presented one option to the staff and subsequently led a workshop discussing the same.</li>
                                <li>As the Teacher in Charge of General Science, I worked with a colleague to develop learning and assessment resources for the General Science courses. Although traditionally seen as a lesser science at the school (compared to the separate science subjects) I was able to nearly double the number of students taking the courses over 2 years. I did this by clearly communicating the course purpose and then delivering relevant and engaging course material.</li>

                                    <a href="http://www.ncsthechallenge.org/" target="_blank">The Challenge</a>
                                    , an English youth development programme focusing on improving inter-personal skills and increasing community cohesion. The programme was partly residential and highly youth led. I completed two three-week programmes, working with a team of 13 staff and 60 young people each time.

                    <p>I am passionate about the environment and tackling climate change. My wife and I are electric vehicle enthusiasts and e-bike converts. We enjoy taking our two dogs for walks and developing our native garden. I am the regular cook at home and my favourite way to spend a sunny weekend would be good food, good wine, and good company.</p>

                        We lived in England for 1 year and travelled through Africa, Europe and the US. More recently we did an Intrepid Food Tour around India. I enjoy travel photography and you can read my blog
